## Abstract
Understanding and certifying the generalization performance of machine learning algorithms---i.e. obtaining *theoretical* estimates of the test error from a finite training sample---is a central theme of statistical learning theory. Among the many complexity measures used to derive such guarantees, *Rademacher complexity* yields sharp, data-dependent bounds that apply well beyond classical $0$--$1$ classification. In this study, we formalize the generalization error bound by *Rademacher complexity* in Lean 4, building on measure-theoretic probability theory available in the Mathlib library. Our development provides a mechanically-checked pipeline from the definitions of empirical and expected Rademacher complexity, through a formal symmetrization argument and a bounded-differences analysis, to high-probability uniform deviation bounds via a formally proved McDiarmid inequality. A key technical contribution is a reusable mechanism for lifting results from *countable* hypothesis classes (where measurability of suprema is straightforward in Mathlib) to *separable* topological index sets via a reduction to a countable dense subset. As worked applications of the abstract theorem, we mechanize standard empirical Rademacher bounds for linear predictors under $\ell_2$ and $\ell_1$ regularization, and we also formalize a Dudley-type entropy integral bound based on covering numbers and a chaining construction.

### Major updated:
(2026 Jan) We have formalized **Dudley's entropy integral bound** for Rademacher complexity for the first time.
(2026 Feb) We have formalized **Lasso, or $L^1$-regularization bound**
